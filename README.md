　　“我是一个没有出息的人。我的感情太多，总是供过于求，经常为一些小动物、小花草惹起万斛闲愁。”季羡林老先生这般说自己。我万万不敢与这老先生比其他东西，可是我敢说，我与老先生有同样的感情。老先生说自己没有出息那是谦虚，我才是个真真确确地地道道彻头彻尾的没有出息的人。“真正的伟人们是决不会这样的。反过来说，如果他们像我这样的话，也决不能成为伟人。我还有点自知之明，我注定是一个渺小的人，也甘于如此，我甘于为一些小猫小狗小花小草流泪叹气。”老先生说得太好了。他哪儿是在说自己呢？分明是在说我。
The magpies smiled, as I fly, named after me.

Whenever at this time, see me in a small town in the north people in the market for them, thousands of miles away white-haired mother that overlooks the eyes on the head by the door, my heart will suddenly surge of wishful thinking and warm.

But I, for his hometown and mother attachment is still so persistent, persistent, almost to innocence.
I ate mother steamed corn land, drank the hometown, the village head of well water reached 18 years of age, and before that never left home that tall woodpile, never left her mother around.
At that time the Chinese New Year is the highest in the old period pleasant, although the hui people New Year's day interest stick couplets, set off firecrackers, but the eve of us three siblings, sitting on a hot kang, and tasting a mother's hand steamed is full of red jujube sweet rice cakes, listen to mother some interesting jokes, but also feel happy.
At night, bright red after the fire to warm the cabin, also reflected the red mother happy smiling face, we in the mother under the caress of sweet to sleep...
.
To the northeast to attend work, though no longer with her mother, as it were, in the morning and night get along with, but every month, just after, my heart longs for the hometown of flew into thousands of miles away, flew to the mother's side.
Just have a job, I in the coal mine when the miners, although very hard, but I am still the monthly general holidays saved up, until the New Year's day, only to return home to visit mother and can stay for some time.
Remember I leave home in the first year, it's already December 28, in the mines has not holiday.
December 29 early in the morning, I finished last night, after the shaft from eating breakfast and rush to straight to the train station, on a train bound for home.
In the bustling crowd on the train, sleepless night I awake, heart, already flew to the life I have my village.
At noon the next day, when I travel-stained appeared in the village, found that the mother is that I know stone grinding side looked at me.
My mind a hot, hurried to the mother's side, only let out a cry "mama", in the eye socket, already filled with tears...
Walked into the door, I saw in the middle of the square table on the kang has just cooked dumplings, steaming, fragrance dispersion.
Dust mother patted me, say hello to dinner I wash my face.
At this point, the naughty children has set up a file in the village of rang off firecrackers, above the village was full of festive holiday atmosphere.
From now on, no matter how busy work, more tired, every year I will be back home before the year New Year's day, not just to eat mother personally package dumplings, but to feel that it is difficult to give up a mother's love and affection, in order to enjoy the New Year in a foreign land is unable to enjoy happiness and warmth.
Later, as the growth of the age, get married and have children of their own.
From then on, then much a responsibility, also added a little helpless.
Yes, how can I throw the wife and daughters every Spring Festival at home, alone back to hometown with his parents and a family reunion?
Since 1987, I rarely go home for the Spring Festival for years, in addition to the marriage and only three back several times, in the rest of the only use the opportunity of once every four years home leave home for the holiday.
Although parents don't give up, they can only helplessly sigh.
The father said, whenever I can't go home for the holiday, mother will be in the New Year's eve in the mosque hall bow down to the west, beg god give hundreds of kilometers away, the son of the family peace.
Parents hope we go home for the holiday, that kind of desire is so strong.
Letter from the year before the Spring Festival eve, the family said that mother was seriously ill, we should go home.
His wife work hard to get away so my daughter and I get home by train.
The arches the micro TuoDe nearly s father body from 10 km railway station take our father got home, just know mother doesn't have a sick, is too miss family in the northeast, is wanted us to celebrate the New Year with her.
After the Spring Festival, the mother didn't let us go, until the Lantern Festival, just unwilling to put us back.
Before leaving, mother always fill the delicious home necessities and snacks with several heavy luggage let me back.
When I too burdensome back to mother and a full face of displeasure, even sometimes sad tears.
So I had to cries farewell parents, back parcel return filled with a mother's love and affection...
Remember the last time to go home New Year's day, mother said to me, your dad and I are more than 70 - year - old man, also can live a few years?
O come back several times as much as possible when you have time.
I replied in tears, mom, you rest assured, I'll often come back with your parents for the holiday.
Though with such a promise, blink of an eye two years you are not the home for the Spring Festival.
Recently, my mother said to me on the phone, don't back to don't back this year, took my granddaughter to walk well.
Old voice on the phone, I heard the mother of the lonely and helpless.
I know that my mother must be envisaged in the year of the dog at this time on New Year's eve and the relatives of a foreign land to return together, sitting around eating, feel happy.
I seemed to see his father's faltering figure and mother vaguely flashing thoughts of tears...
At the moment, the year of the dog almost, setting off of firecrackers is early started ringing in the window.
Playing in the snow, my thoughts have been falling village of wood smoke curled up in my dream.
Mother, the Spring Festival next year, I must go home for the holiday!
